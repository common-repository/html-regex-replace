Replace any html you write in editor (Visual or HTML) with pre-defined string.
Use Regexp to define patterns for replacement.

== Description ==

<strong>HTML Regex Replace</strong> use find&replace mechanism based on regexp
for your posts/pages. Plugin <em>finds</em> html or text <em>using regular
expressions</em> and replaces it with predefined <em>'New string'</em>.
Unlimited replacement rules. You can specify any amount of short codes, and no buttons!

For example:

<code>
(c) -> Copyright
[me] -> My Full Name
</code>
Short code '(c)' will be replaced with 'Copyright' and '[me]' with 'My Full Name'.

More than that you can fix html code or remove unwanted automatically inserted html
(for example, chrome-auto-translate-plugin-dialog inserted by Auto-Translate
chrome plugin).
